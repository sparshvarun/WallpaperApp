Technologies used :

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) - Our architectural foundation, enabling a modular, efficient, and testable codebase.

Coroutines - For asynchronous programming, ensuring smooth performance without blocking the UI thread.

ViewModel - To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, making our app more robust and manageable.

Retrofit - Our choice for network calls, thanks to its simplicity and power in handling REST APIs.

Glide - For efficient image loading and caching, ensuring our wallpapers look stunning without sacrificing performance.

Hilt - For dependency injection, simplifying the code and reducing boilerplate.
